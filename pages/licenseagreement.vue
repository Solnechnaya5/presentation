        memberships, or other content or in-game services (each a, “Paid Content”). If you decide to order any
        such Paid Content, you must ensure that:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul class="lower-alpha_list">
            <li>you are either an individual over the age of eighteen (18) or, if you are under the age of eighteen (18)
                or if you have limited legal capacity, that your parent or legal guardian has agreed to and accepted the
                respective order on your behalf;</li>
            <li>you are the authorised Account holder for the Account from which you are making the order;</li>
            <li> you are authorised to use the particular credit card or other accepted method of payment; and</li>
            <li> all information that you submit is true and accurate (this includes, without limitation, your credit card
                number and expiration date, so it is important to keep these details updated).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>5.2. The following rules apply to Paid Content:</p>
    <p>
        <ul class="lower-alpha_list">
            <li>To order Paid Content or Services, you need to have an Account, initiate and conclude the order
                process.</li>
        <li> If you would like to order Paid Content, you must log in into your Account and enter the requested
                information about you and your payment method. When you click the “PAY NOW” button (or similar
                conspicuously designated button), you make a binding offer to Vireye to conclude a contract for the
                supply of Paid Content (“Contract”). Until the moment you click such button, you can correct the data
                that you have entered. Our confirmation of the Contract by e-mail represents our acceptance of your
                offer (time of the conclusion of the Contract).</li>
            <li> In case we accept your order, we will, directly after that, credit the ordered Paid Content to your
                Account and we will charge you via your selected payment method.</li>
            <li>Paid Content may only be redeemed for other content and services where permitted in the Services;</li>
            <li>Ordered Paid Content are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them),
                except as set forth in this EULA or required under the applicable law;</li>
            <li>Paid Content cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other content and services
                as permitted in the Services);</li>
            <li>you may only acquire Paid Content from us; and</li>
            <li>we may reject an offer to order Paid Content for any reason.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to withdraw from any Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The
        withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the Contract. To exercise
        the right of withdrawal, you must inform us, at 
        <Mailto mail="legal@vireye.com" title="legal@vireye.com" />, of your decision to withdraw from the
        Contract by an unequivocal statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your
        exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you withdraw from the Contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you under this
        Contract, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from
        your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us),
        without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which we are
        informed about your decision to withdraw from this Contract. We will carry out such reimbursement
        using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly
        agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have requested that the services begin during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us a reasonable
        amount corresponding to the proportion of the services already provided up to the time you have
        communicated us of the exercise of the right of withdrawal from that Contract, in comparison with the
        full coverage of these services under the Contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.3. Based on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Paid Content, you consent that we make
        available these Paid Content to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of
        withdrawal once the Paid Content or Services have been made fully available to you by us.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.4. Please note that due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a
        specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method. You agree that
        reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g.
        via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via these payment methods are
        technically impossible. In any case, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.5. “Subscription” means granting of rights to Paid Content in Vireye game(s) under the applicable EULA
        subject to automatic renewal of such rights by automatically debiting funds from the user’s payment
        method.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.6. The Paid Content that the user subscribes to, the price of the Subscription, and the time intervals at
        which the user’s payment method will be charged shall be clearly specified in the interface of the shop
        or other place where the Subscription is offered. The funds shall be automatically debited from the
        payment method specified by the user during the Subscription process.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.7. The price of the Subscription may increase or decrease due to a change of the user’s payment
        currency, exchange rates monetization policy, the game economy, or in other cases where the price
        change is justified by compliance with law, generally accepted industry practices, improvement of the
        game.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.8. Vireye shall send a preliminary notice of the price change to the user’s email address linked to his or
        her Vireye Account or by other means. Such notice shall be sent reasonably in advance to enable the
        user to make an informed decision on whether to keep the Subscription at the new price.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.9. Such preliminary notice shall contain the new Subscription price and enable the user to easily cancel
        the Subscription. If the user does not cancel the Subscription within the time specified in the notice, the
        Subscription shall continue at the new price.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.10. The user may cancel the Subscription at any time. The user will still be able to use the Paid Content
        acquired via Subscription and remaining before the end of the current Subscription period. Vireye will
        not return the funds for such Paid Content unless required by the EULA and/or law.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.11. Subscription shall be automatically stopped if the user’s payment method may not be charged for
        any reason before the start of the next Subscription period, e.g. due to insufficient funds of unavailability
        of the payment method. The user may re-subscribe after fixing the payment method.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.12. If the user exercises his or her withdrawal right according of the EULA and/or law, the Subscription
        will be cancelled. The user can purchase another Subscription at any time after he or she exercises the
        right of withdrawal.

    <h2>11. Feedback and User Submissions</h2>
    <p>
        11.1. We are always pleased to hear from our users and welcome specific comments about our Services.
        Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider
        creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we have specifically requested. The aim of this
        policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects that we develop might seem
        to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not
        send us any original creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information such as
        game ideas or original artwork (“Submissions“).
    </p>
    <p>
        11.2. Any and all Submissions that you send to us, whether at our specific request or notwithstanding
        our request that you do not do so, shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property to the maximum
        extent permitted by the applicable law from the time of uploading or transmission.
    </p>
    <h2>12. Links to Third-Party Websites</h2>
    <p>
        The Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties including advertisers and
        other content providers. Those sites may collect data or solicit personal information from you. We do not
        control such web sites, and are not responsible for their content, privacy policies, or for the collection,
        use or disclosure of any information those sites may collect.
    </p>
    <h2>13. Warranties and Liabilities</h2>
    <p>
        13.1. If Services are nonconforming, you may, if the conditions are met, (i) demand supplementary
        performance, (ii) as the case may be, withdraw from or terminate the Contract or reduce the price, and ,
        subject to the applicable law, (iii) claim damages or reimbursement of futile expenses with the exception
        of Services that are offered by us free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.2. We shall be liable for damages and personal harm resulting from the absence of a warranted
        characteristic or due to gross negligence or intent on our part, our representatives, employees or agents.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.3. In addition, we shall be liable in the event of slightly negligent breaches of material contractual
        obligations, but limited in amount to the damage typically foreseeable. Material contractual obligations
        are, in the abstract, obligations the fulfilment of which makes the proper performance of a contract
        possible in the first place and on the fulfilment of which the contracting parties may regularly rely.
    </p>
    <p>13.4. And further liability of us is hereby excluded to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        14.1. Our and your legal rights to delete your Account and terminate this EULA for cause remain
        unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
        14.2. If a termination for cause is prompted by a breach of a contractual obligation under this EULA from
        our side, you are entitled to a refund for any payments made by you for premium in-game currency that
        at the time of termination has not been used by you in exchange for other Paid Content. Other than that,
        you will not be entitled to any refunds except as set forth in this EULA or required under the applicable
        law.
    </p>
    <p>14.3. You may terminate this EULA without cause at any time by deleting your Account.</p>
    <p>
        14.4. Any Paid Content that you ordered from us is directly linked to the existence of your Account. If you
        decide to delete your Account and terminate this EULA without cause, you will lose any Paid Content
        accessible from that Account at the time of the termination. You will not be entitled to any refunds. This
        section does not limit your statutory right of withdrawal under section 6 above.
    </p>
    <p>
        14.5. If you are in breach of this EULA, then we may, depending on the seriousness of the breach, take
        some or all of the following actions:
        <ul class="lower-alpha_list">
            <li>Suspend or permanently close your access to individual features of one or several Services. You will
                not be able to use such features and Paid Content or Services in connection with them, but you will still
                have access to other parts of the Services.</li>
            <li>Suspend or permanently close your access to individual Services. You will not be able to access such
                Services and use any Paid Content in them.</li>
            <li>Suspend or permanently close your access to your Account. You will not be able to access your
                Account and use any Paid Content in it during the suspension period, and we may also prohibit you from
                accessing or using any/all Services in the future.</li>
            <li>terminate this EULA and delete your Account.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        14.6. If the breach of this EULA is your first breach, if it is not serious, if it is capable of cure, and if the
        circumstances allow us to do so, then we give you fourteen (14) calendar days prior written notice of the
        impending Account closure to give you the opportunity to cure the breach during such time period.
    </p>
    <p>
        14.7. We will permanently close your access to your Account or delete your Account in serious
        circumstances where we consider that a temporary suspension is not sufficient. For example, this might
        include a serious or repeated breach of this EULA.
    </p>
    <p>
        14.8. If we suspend your access or delete your Account due to your breach of this EULA, you will not be
        entitled to any refunds, unless otherwise required by applicable law. This section does not limit your
        statutory right of withdrawal under section 6 above.
    </p>

        International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the conflict of laws rules. If you are a consumer habitually
        resident in the EU, you also enjoy protection of the mandatory provisions of the law of your country of
        residence. The exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Cyprus is agreed. This means that you may bring an
        action to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with this EULA only in Cyprus.

        other part of this EULA. Also, we and you agree to interpret the rest of this EULA in such a way as to
        reflect your and our intentions in this EULA as far as possible.
